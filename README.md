# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

### Academic codes ðŸŽ“
Iâ€™m currently studying Simulation Sciences M.Sc. and post the code of my study projects in the [Simulation Sciences M.Sc.](https://github.com/sebastian-linden/Simulation-Sciences-M.Sc.) repository. 


### Fun and Learning ðŸª´
I am also sharing my private coding projects, which I do either purely for pleasure or to learn something new. One of the things, that I learned recently was git. This is the reason, why I now use GitHub. Hence, you seeing my projects is the very result of my journey of learning how to code.
