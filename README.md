### Fun and Learning ðŸª´
I am sharing my private coding projects, which I do either purely for pleasure or to learn something new. One of the things, that I learned recently was git. This is the reason, why I now use GitHub. Hence, you seeing my projects is the very result of my journey of learning how to code.

### Academic Stuff ðŸŽ“
Also, I am currently studying Simulation Sciences M.Sc., where I have to write a ton of scientific code. I post the code of my study projects in the [Simulation Sciences M.Sc.](https://github.com/sebastian-linden/Simulation-Sciences-M.Sc.) repository.
